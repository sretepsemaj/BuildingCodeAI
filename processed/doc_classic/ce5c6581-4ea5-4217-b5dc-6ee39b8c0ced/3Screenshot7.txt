GENERAL REGULATIONS

shall be closed and a pressure equivalent to a 1-inch water column (248.8 Pa) shall be held for a test period of not less
than 15 minutes.

312.5 Water supply system test. Upon completion of a section of or the entire water supply system, the system, or
portion completed, shall be tested and proved tight under a water pressure of 50 psi (344 kPa) above its normal
working pressure but not less than 150 psi (1033 kPa). This pressure shall be held for not less than 15 minutes. The
water utilized for tests shall be obtained from a potable source of supply. The required tests shall be performed in
accordance with this section and Section 108.

312.5.1 Water service pipe. In addition to any requirements of Section 312.5, tests for water service pipes shall
comply with the following:

1. In the presence of the tapper or inspector of the Department of Environmental Protection, each new service
pipe or repaired service pipe shall be subjected to a water test made under the street main pressure.

2, All such pipes and appurtenances shall remain uncov-ered for the duration of the test and shall show no sign
of leakage.

3. When any question arises as to the installation conforming with these regulations, an internal hydrostatic test
as specified for materials may be applied, subject to the approval of the Department of Environmental Pro-
tection.

312.6 Reserved.

312.7 Forced drain test. Forced drain tests shall consist of plugging the end of the pump discharge at the point of
connection with the building drain and applying a pressure of 5 psi (34.5 kPa) greater than the shut off pump rating,
and maintaining such pressure for 15 minutes.

312.8 Storm drainage system test. Storm drain systems shall be tested by water or air in accordance with Section
312.2 or 312.3. Where storm drainage piping is designed to run full, the system shall be tested to withstand the head
of 10 feet (3048 mm) of water above the anticipated high water level.

Exception: Storm drainage piping installed outside of a building shall be tested to withstand the head of water
equal to grade, but such testing may be conducted after inspection and backfilling.

312.9 Shower liner test. Where shower floors and receptors are made water tight by the application of materials
required by Section 417.5.2, the completed liner installation shall be tested. The pipe from the shower drain shall be
plugged water tight for the test. The floor and receptor area shall be filled with potable water to a depth of not less
than 2 inches (51 mm) measured at the threshold. Where a threshold of at least 2 inches (51 mm) high does not exist,
a temporary threshold shall be constructed to retain the test water in the lined floor or receptor area to a level not less
than 2 inches (51 mm) deep measured at the threshold. The water shall be retained for a test period of not less than 15
minutes, and there shall not be evidence of leakage.

312.10 Inspection and testing of backflow prevention assemblies. Inspection and testing of secondary backflow
prevention assemblies shall comply with Sections 312.10. and 312.10.2.

312.10.1 Inspections. Annual inspections shall be made of all backflow prevention assemblies, air gaps, spill-
proof vacuum breakers, pressure vacuum breaker assemblies, and hose connection backflow preventers to deter-
mine whether they are operable on forms provided by the department. Such forms shall be retained by the owner
and shall be made available upon request to the department for a period of five years.

312.10.2 Testing. Reduced pressure principle, double check, pressure vacuum breaker, reduced pressure detector
fire protection, double check detector fire protection, and spill-resistant vacuum breaker backflow preventer as-
semblies and hose connection backflow preventers shall be tested at the time of installation, immediately after
repairs or relocation and annually thereafter. The testing procedure shall be performed in accordance with one of
the following standards: ASSE 5013, ASSE 5015, ASSE 5020, ASSE 5047, ASSE 5048, ASSE 5052, ASSE 5056,
CSA B64.10 or CSA B64.10.1. Refer to Section 608.13 and the Department of Environmental Protection for
additional testing requirements.

312.11 Joint inspection. Inspections of welded joints shall consist of visual examination, during or after manufacture,
fabrication, assembly, or pressure tests as appropriate. Supplementary types of nondestructive inspection techniques,
